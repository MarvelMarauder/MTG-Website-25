Speaking of Ben Reilly, he helps you out by giving you a choice: you can cast him early and have him be a solid early game creature with 4 power, OR you can wait until the late game, cast, a HUGE creature, hit someone with it, and while they're grumbling, pull that creature back and slam Ben Reilly down with his Web-Slinging ability and make him EVEN BIGGER!",
