The goal with this deck is a little more complicated, but a little stronger than the Bilbo version of the deck. Here, you use Frodo to attack opponents and draw cards. Card draw is SUPER important in Magic. Then you use Sam to generate a ton of Food tokens, and since he reduces their cost, you can gain life even easier. Essentially, this is a grindy, slow, ridiculously hard to kill deck because you draw tons of cards, hit people with creatures, and just gain so much life. You'll be really hard to kill.",
