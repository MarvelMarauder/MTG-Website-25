Of course there are lots of cards that payoff from you gaining life, so you can make creatures bigger with your lifegain, but the goal is the get to 111 life. Cause if you can get to that level of life, then it's all over for everyone else. So it's extremely important that you focus on KILLING YOUR OPPONENENTS THINGS. There aren't a ton of ways to do this in the deck, but if you can fly under the radar for a while and simply gain life quietly, then find one of your big spells that kill all the creatures, you should be golden. This is a hard gameplan to pull off, but the rewards are incredible.",
