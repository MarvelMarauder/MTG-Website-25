But every time they do that, your creatures get bigger.. \nThus, the goal of this deck is to manipulate the rest of the table to attack anyone that is not you. And I've put cards in here that make it either very difficult or very annoying to attack you to help you out. Then once you've delayed them attacking you for long enough... you swing with your huge creatures and kill them all.",
